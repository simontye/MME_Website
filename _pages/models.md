# Simulations of mass mortality events
Here are some simulations to play with. More information, someday, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

## Model framework
These models are built on X, Y, and Z. To learn more about these models, see this page (Model, then change this page to Simulations?). More information, someday, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

Parameter values are as follows. More information, someday, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

## Scenarios
The simualtions are organized by trophic structure. These options are available. More information, someday, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

# Three trophic levels
## (1 Resource, 1 Herbivore, 1 Predator)
These models include a tri-trophic system with X, Y, and Z.

# Four trophic levels
## (1 Resource, 1 Primary Consumer, 1 Secondary consumer, 1 Predator)
These models include a tri-trophic system with X, Y, and Z.
